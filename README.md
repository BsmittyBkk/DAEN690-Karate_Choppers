# DAEN690-Karate_Choppers
DAEN Summer Capstone Project focusing on   IDENTIFICATION, CHARACTERIZATION, AND ANALYSIS OF ROTORCRAFT FLIGHT MANEUVERS USING SIMULATED FLIGHT DATA

# Objectives
The goal of this project is to conduct reasearch, create a report, and create machine learning models to accurately and efficiently detect and classify a subset of maneuvers in rotocraft. The data used in this project is in-flight simulated data from a rotorcraft flight simulator using a AW-139 model.
